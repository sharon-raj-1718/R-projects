# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-on-PIMA-Indian-Diabetes-Database
Knowledge Discovery in Database
* In this project we focused our analysis on applying data analysis techniques, create visualizations and interpret the models using histograms, scatter plots and many other visual plots etc. to uncover the reason for high diabetic outcome among the PIMA Indian women. 
* Predict whether the patient is diagnosed with diabetes based on diagnostic measurements available in the dataset.
* We obtained this dataset from Kaggle and built some supervised explanatory models (classification tree and logistic regression) and predictive models (KNN); also tried Unsupervised techniques such as K-means Clustering and Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map (SOM). 
* Languages and tools used: R Programming, R Studio, WEKA and Tableau.
